This is a refactored version of my RocketU Bootcamp final project.

The idea: A hybrid of Reddit and Facebook. Share and explore genuine content in familiar reddit style, while interacting with your closest friends.

Technologies used: Python, Django, Django Rest Framework, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and AngularJS.
